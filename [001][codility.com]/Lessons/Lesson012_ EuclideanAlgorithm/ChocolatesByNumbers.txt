Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N − 1.

You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.

You begin with eating chocolate number 0. Then you omit the next M − 1 chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.

More precisely, if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the chocolate with number (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).

You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.

For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. You will eat the following chocolates: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6.

The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following the above rules.

Write a function:

function solution(N, M);
that, given two positive integers N and M, returns the number of chocolates that you will eat.

For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. the function should return 5, as explained above.

Assume that:

N and M are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N+M));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(log(N+M)).

-(a%c + b)%c = (a+b)%c
Proof:
	a=a1*c + c1
	b=b1*c + c2
=> (a%c + b)%c = (c1 + b1*c + c2)%c = (c1+ c2)%c = (a+b)%c	


-After k steps, stop at (k*M)%N 
-Every position: a < N 
=> revisit: a after k steps when: (k*M + a)%N = a 
=> k*M + a = k1*N + a => (k*M) % N === 0 
k*M1*gcd = k2*N1*gcd
=> k = k2*N1/M1 >= N1 
Min k = N1 when k2=M1 
=> k = N/gcd 
-Start at 0 => next stop at i 
if i === 0 => k = N/gcd
else i !=== 0 => next step ....
every other position we can stop with k < N/gcd
=> k = N/gcd
