There are a number of buildings in a certain two-dimensional landscape. Each building has a height, given by . If you join  adjacent buildings, they will form a solid rectangle of area .

For example, the heights array . A rectangle of height  and length  can be constructed within the boundaries. The area formed is .

Function Description

Complete the function largestRectangle int the editor below. It should return an integer representing the largest rectangle that can be formed within the bounds of consecutive buildings.

largestRectangle has the following parameter(s):

h: an array of integers representing building heights
Input Format
