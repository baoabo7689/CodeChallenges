Given  integers, compute their average correct to three decimal places.

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer, . 
 lines follow, each containing a single integer.

Output Format 
Display the average of the  integers, rounded off to three decimal places.

Input Constraints 
 
 ( refers to elements of the list of integers for which the average is to be computed)

Sample Input

4
1
2
9
8
Sample Output

5.000
Explanation 
The '4' in the first line indicates that there are four integers whose average is to be computed. The average = (1 + 2 + 9 + 8)/4 = 20/4 = 5.000 (correct to three decimal places) Please include the zeroes even if they are redundant (e.g. 0.000 instead of 0).
