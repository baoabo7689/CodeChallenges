Given a text file, count the number of times each line repeats itself (only consider consecutive repetions). Display the count and the line, separated by a space. There shouldn't be leading or trailing spaces. Please note that the uniq -c command by itself will generate the output in a different format.

This time, compare consecutive lines in a case insensitive manner. So, if a line X is followed by case variants, the output should count all of them as the same (but display only the form X in the second column).

So, as you might observe in the case below: aa, AA and Aa are all counted as instances of 'aa'.

Sample Input

00
00
01
01
00
00
02
02
03
aa
AA
Aa
Sample Output

2 00
2 01
2 00
2 02
1 03
3 aa 
Explanation

00 is repeated twice
01 is repeated twice
00 is repeated twice
02 is repeated twice
03 occurs once
aa is repeated thrice (if we ignore case - AA, Aa are the same as 'aa')

Plain Uniq

If this is the file test.txt:

00
00
01
01
00
00
02
02
This is the output on passing it through the uniq command, either via pipes or as input via STDIN:

Command:  uniq < test.txt 

00
01
00
02  
The first two lines of the original file are the same, . The next two lines are  which are followed by two repetitions of  again and two repetitions of . The uniq command replaces the consecutive repetitions with only one line in each case.

Uniq with counts

uniq -c < test.txt
This example indicates the count of repetitions for each of the lines it collapses.

If this is the test file, testCounts.txt:

00
00
01
01
00
00
02
02
03
aa
aa
aa

Command: uniq -c < input00.txt    

      2 00
      2 01
      2 00
      2 02
      1 03
      3 aa
The first number is the count of the repeated occurrences in the original file.

Printing only duplicate lines

The -d option only prints those lines that are followed by one or more repetitions immediately after them:

uniq -d < testCounts.txt  
OR

cat testCounts.txt | uniq -d  
OR

uniq -d testCounts.txt  
Printing only unique lines

The -u option only prints those lines that are succeeded and preceded by different lines:

uniq -u < testCounts.txt  
OR

cat testCounts.txt | uniq -u  
OR

uniq -u testCounts.txt
Other possible options:

Limit comparison only to the first  characters (using the -w option).
Avoid comparing the first  characters (using the -s option).
Ignore variations in case between lines (using the -i option).
Avoid comparing the first  fields (using the -f option). 
(This may be useful while processing TSV files when you'd like to ignore the first column if it has serial numbers.)
You might find these examples interesting and useful.
